# PricingEstimator
An application developed as part of an internship program to streamline the work of the production manager and project manager.

The development teams at the company worked in the Scrum methodology. They used a Story Point (SP) unit to determine the complexity of a given task to be completed. The team manager wanted to obtain information about the average ratio of the designated Story Points to the actual time spent on the project (expressed in Man Day unit) by each team. Such information would help him estimate the time needed to complete subsequent projects.

The second part of the project was to prepare a system for creating so-called Developments. A Development is a draft of a quote presented to a client based on a project commissioned by the client. The development has:
- Name
- Assigned Team
- Assigned Project
- Assigned client
- Links to external sources related to the development
- The number of SPs specified by the team
- The number of Mandays assigned for the purposes of Team work, analysis, management and implementation of the project.
- The number of man-days presented to the client

The project manager can dissect the details of development - to include individual tasks related to project work. These can be informational only, or contain their own SP and MD values that add up to an overall category.
